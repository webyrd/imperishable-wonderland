# Introduction

Welcome to the Wonderland!

## Imperishable!

### Such Wonderland!

Yesss!

[relational Scheme interpreter]

[quines, twines, thrines]

[generating twines using absento rather than =/=]

[quasiquote quines from ICFP 2017 pearl]

[synthesizing append from input/output examples, with and without eigens, etc.]

[synthesizing append from associativity property + eigens]

[relational type inference and type inhabitation]

[Matt Might's proof checker turned into a theorem prover via relational interpreter from ICFP 2017 pearl]

[encoding negation via relational Scheme interpreter]

[mini-in-mini for synthesis of mk relations and run expressions]

[conjunction of deep + shallow embeddings of mk-in-mk to get improved performance from the shallow embedding but the improved expressiveness (`run*` instead of `run 1`) from the deep embedding]
