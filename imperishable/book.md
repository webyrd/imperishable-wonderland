# Introduction

Welcome to the Wonderland!

## Imperishable!

### Such Wonderland!

Yesss!

[relational Scheme interpreter]

[quines, twines, thrines]

[generating twines using absento rather than =/=]

[synthesizing quasiquote quines in micro-Scheme in Scheme in mk from ICFP 2017 pearl]

[these interpreter examples but with a staged evaluator]

[self-reps and viruses]

[synthesizing omega as a small-step quine]

[synthesizing combinatory logic terms, including for fixed point combinators]

[synthesizing append from input/output examples, with and without eigens, etc.]

[synthesizing append from associativity property + eigens]

[dynamic scope vs. static/lexical scope and program synthesis, from ICFP 2017 pearl example --- synthesize a program that evaluates to different values under dynamic scope vs. lexical scope]

[explicit handling of errors in relational interpreter and angelic execution via relational interpreter -- see Polyconf 2015]

[incorrectness logic and the new two-sided sequent calculus type system stuff from POPL'24 --- implement relationally]

[relational type inference and type inhabitation]

[Matt Might's proof checker turned into a theorem prover via relational interpreter from ICFP 2017 pearl]

[encoding negation via relational Scheme interpreter]

[mini-in-mini for synthesis of mk relations and run expressions]

[conjunction of deep + shallow embeddings of mk-in-mk to get improved performance from the shallow embedding but the improved expressiveness (`run*` instead of `run 1`) from the deep embedding]

[relational exploration of the Chomsky Hierarchy]
