Description of the contents of the images in this directory.

`playing_with_titles_old.jpg`: JPEG image of a 3 inch by 5 inch index card, creased and with a coffee stain in the middle, containing one of the many titles I considered for this project months ago, in purple ink that has been slightly smeared in one spot from water. The text on the card says: 'Imperishable Wonderland of Infinite Fun: Voyages in the Relational Universe'.
