* Explore 3D code and quoted procedures in the relational interpreter

Explore the strange-looking behavior of shallow and deep embedding of the same language for mk-in-mk, and how combining both interpreters in one query sharing logic variables representing the same program can result in increased expressive power (deep embedding giving run* semantics rather than run 1 semantics), but with efficiency closer to that of the shallow embedding. (see my mk-in-mk experiments with these two interps--which repo is that in, again?)
What other behaviors in which we perform a conjunction of multiple interpreters for the same or similar languages, sharing fresh logic variables, seem interesting in a similar way, or which might shine light on this behavior?
* Dynamic vs. lexical scope interpreters in 2017 ICFP Pearl
* Generation of simple multi-language quines using relational interpreters for two Scheme-like languages. (https://github.com/webyrd/multi-quine)
Is this (or similar) behavior(s) seen in other contexts?

300 Orders of Magnitude or Bust! (Based on a CPP'24 talk showing Monte Carlo simulation + reinforcement learning applied to automated theorem proving finding a proof in a search tree with a branching factor of 10, at a depth of 300, equivalent to finding a solution in a search space of 10^300 (or so it is claimed).  I want the equivalent, or better, for search in miniKanren, for the relational Scheme interpreter and other relational programs.)
