# Major 'Arcs' (in the manga/anime sense)

The Most Beautiful Program Ever Written (extensions, including errors and angelic execution, delimited control/effect handlers, store-passing style, mutation, etc.)

Build Your Own Barliman

300 Orders of Magnitude or Bust! (Based on a CPP'24 talk showing Monte Carlo simulation + reinforcement learning applied to automated theorem proving finding a proof in a search tree with a branching factor of 10, at a depth of 300, equivalent to finding a solution in a search space of 10^300 (or so it is claimed).  I want the equivalent, or better, for search in miniKanren, for the relational Scheme interpreter and other relational programs.)

A Course of Instruction in Programming Languages, Relational Style (interpreters, type checkers/inferencers, semantics, computability theory, proof checkers, automated theorem provers, compilers, etc., all explored from a relational point of view; think of ideas found in EoPL, TAPL, SICP, TLS, <add your own programming languages textbook here>, relational style)


# Assorted topics (some of these may be promoted to Arcs, and moved above)

Logic programming approaches of different expressive power, and with different semantics (especially regarding negation), termination guarantees, and complexity classes.  Explore the mk equivalents as well.
* Prolog
* Datalog
* Answer Set Programming

negation and all that
* negation as failure
* the Clark completion (spelling?)
* conda and condu
* the g-rule
* the problems
* stratified negation
* ASP notion of negation and stable model semantics
* explicit encoding of constructive negation by writing a `not-<fooo>` relation as a counterpoint to your "positive" `fooo` relation
* encoding negative information through the relational Scheme interpreter: failure to pattern match, `not` as a Scheme predicate, etc.  What is the power, expressiveness, complexity, etc.?  To what extent can staging the interpreter and other techniques reduce the overhead?

different ways to go from Scheme to miniKanren:
* hand-transformation
* compile
* Scheme interpeter in mk

different ways to implement miniKanren:
* abstract machine
* deep embedding
* shallow embedding
* interpreter
* compiler
* FPGA
* ASIC

macros and miniKanren:
* a basic intro to Scheme macros
* macros in context, including how to use macros effectively:
** how the macros in miniKanren work
** alternative interfaces to miniKanren
*** `defrel`
*** alternative `run` interfaces
** writing various test macros

how to debug miniKanren programs
* causes of divergence
* causes of failure
* causes of unexpected behavior
* standard 'gotchas'
* `run 1` vs. `run *`
* running a relation with all variables fresh

program transformations, from a relational perspective:
* transformations of relational programs
* transformations implemented relationally

What makes a program relational?  What does that mean?  How can you tell if a program is relational?
