# What is this book?

This book is a collection of potentially useful resources related to miniKanren (and miniKanren-like languages), and related to relational programming more broadly.  I describe each of these resources, attempting to balance being fair and level-headed with my personal idiosyncratic view of relational programming and miniKanren.

# Why this book?

There does not currently exist a curated, opinionated collection of the most important miniKanren-related resources.  The main [miniKanren website](http://www.minikanren.org) contains links to some of these resources, but serves disparate purposes: providing a quick overview of miniKanren; announcing workshops; linking to various implementations of miniKanren and microKanren submitted by the creators of those implementations; linking to old blog posts about miniKanren; etc. The website is also intended to serve the needs of the overall miniKanren community, and avoids expressing opinions.

# The writing philosophy behind this book

This collection is a work in progress, and is intended to evolve over time.  Also, as I better understand the context of work, I may revise my opinion, or even decide to remove a resource that no longer seems as important in the current miniKanren landscape.

I will attempt to be fair in my descriptions of each work, even as I use my best judgement in the selection of the works, and my view on the importance of the work to relational programming.  I will try to be clear when I don't think I understand a work, or its context or intent.  If you think I am off in my assessments, or that I'm missing the point of a work, or that I misunderstand the technical details, or have overlooked an important work, etc., please let me know!  I'm happy to consider other perspectives.  Still, I'd rather have this book retain my perspective than merely be a list of paper titles, or whatever, so I reserve the right to stick with my original assessment.

# Who is the audience for this book?

Anyone interested in miniKanren or relational programming who is trying to make sense of the bewildering number of implementations, and growing number papers, talks, and books related to miniKanren.
