Writing Log

Tuesday, March 12, 2024

Session 1

Showed off pinned repo on GitHub: `imperishable-wonderland`

Created this writing log that will include sticky notes I use to communicate with viewers when making silent writing videos, along with what I attempted and/or accomplished during my writing sessions.  I will order the log entries so that the most recent writting sessions come first.

Created a new file `contents.txt` in the `images` directory that contains the contents of the image files in that directory.
