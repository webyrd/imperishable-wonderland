# Writing Log

## Sunday, March 17, 2024

Today I went through my private GitHub and BitBucket repos, and went through private repos on my laptop.  I didn't record this work, since some of the repos are for unpublished work with collaborators, etc.

I still have to write up about 50 repos on my laptop.  ~20 years of hacking with collaborators adds up!

### Session 2

Switched from LaTeX to Markdown and Pandoc.  I want to do this to keep from ending up with a format (PDF or complex LaTeX/BibTeX/etc) that is hard to read or manipulate, and hard to translate to other formats.

The switch to Markdown and Pandoc seemed painless enough.  I'll have to get used to giving up some control over formatting.  The extended Pandoc version of Markdown has special features that might prove useful.  I updated the Makefile to generate a PDF version of the document from the Markdown.  I could also do more fancy LaTeX generation, but I'll defer that for now.

### Session 1

Showed off pinned repo on GitHub: `imperishable-wonderland`

Created this writing log that will include sticky notes I use to communicate with viewers when making silent writing videos, along with what I attempted and/or accomplished during my writing sessions.  I will order the log entries so that the most recent writting sessions come first.

Created a new file `contents.txt` in the `images` directory that contains the contents of the image files in that directory.

Added a `README.md` file for the book in the `imperishable` directory, and included the Creative Commons CC BY Attribution 4.0 International license for the book and said that the code was under an MIT license, but to check the code for details.

Added the Creative Commons CC BY Attribution 4.0 International license to a new page in the book itself.  Created a new `macros.tex` file to contain handy LaTeX macros, such as the `wspace` (Will's Space) macro to give just a tiny bit of vertical spacing.
