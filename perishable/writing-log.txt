### Session 1

Writing on 'How I Think About Relational Programming'.

## Wednesday, March 27, 2024

### Session 1

Added to `topics.txt` from email I sent myself earlier today.

Started Yet Another New Book, 'How I Think About Relational Programming', to talk about...how I think about relational programming, starting with these new topics.

## Tuesday, March 26, 2024

### Session 1

Added [TODO] to empty sections of Big Boring Braindump book so that the PDF would display the sections correctly on the page.  Worked on entries.

## Monday, March 25, 2024

### Session 1

Started Yet Another Book!  'Will’s Dubious and Opinionated Collection of miniKanren and Relational Programming Resources', which will be a collection of lovely and most useful resources related to miniKanren and reltional programming that may be useful, along with my questionable take on these resources.

## Sunday, March 24, 2024

### Session 1

Put in 18 minutes on 'Will's Big Bad Boring Braindump on Relational Programming', describing tradeoffs of the EDSL approach to miniKanren.

## Saturday, March 23, 2024

### Session 2

Put in 45 minutes on 'Confused Will’s Big List of Things He’d Like to Know about Relational Programming'

### Session 1

Put in an hour on 'Will's Big Bad Boring Braindump on Relational Programming'

## Friday, March 22, 2024

### Session 4

Continued working on 'Will's Big List', listing more questions and filling in some intro sections.

### Session 3

Started yet another book: 'Confused Will’s Big List of Things He’d Like to Know about Relational Programming'

Sort of the dual to 'An Imperishable Wonderland of Infinite Fun', although really both books will explore the Wonders and Mysteries of my beloved Relational Programming!

This book is about the things I find really mysterious, or really promising, and would love to see explored deeply, either by me or by others.

### Session 2

Added topics and a super-rough outline for parts of the Big Bad Braindump.

### Session 1

Created new book, 'Will's Big Bad Boring Braindump on Relational Programming', which I intend to worrk on at the same time as 'An Imperishable Wonderland of Infinite Fun'.  This book, as advertised, is intended to be a giant, semi-organized (at best!) braindump of everything I know about relational programming and miniKanren.  Hence, the book is located in the `perishable` subdirectory of this repository.

## Tuesday, March 19, 2024

Today I had many stimulating conversations regarding logic, logic programming, functional programming, machine learning, search, etc.  I've recorded many of these ideas in my private topics file.  I'll think about which I can make public.  I plan to start triaging topics, public and private, soon.

Looking forward to making more videos soon.

## Monday, March 18, 2024

This morning I woke up early and finished going through the private repos on my laptop.

I now have a list of interesting private repos on GitHub, BitBucket, and my laptop, with short descriptions of their contents.

I need to: (1) figure out which of these I can add to the public `ideas.txt` file; (2) triage the public ideas; (3) triage the private ideas.

This is taking longer than I had hoped for, although it's actually only been a week since I started this repo and writing log.  I need to remind myself of 'TTT' from Piet Hein's 'Grooks': Things Take Time.

## Sunday, March 17, 2024

Today I went through my private GitHub and BitBucket repos, and went through private repos on my laptop.  I didn't record this work, since some of the repos are for unpublished work with collaborators, etc.

I still have to write up about 50 repos on my laptop.  ~20 years of hacking with collaborators adds up!

Going through miniKanren.org to collect more ideas and implementations and documents

### Session 2

Switched from LaTeX to Markdown and Pandoc.  I want to do this to keep from ending up with a format (PDF or complex LaTeX/BibTeX/etc) that is hard to read or manipulate, and hard to translate to other formats.

The switch to Markdown and Pandoc seemed painless enough.  I'll have to get used to giving up some control over formatting.  The extended Pandoc version of Markdown has special features that might prove useful.  I updated the Makefile to generate a PDF version of the document from the Markdown.  I could also do more fancy LaTeX generation, but I'll defer that for now.

### Session 1

Showed off pinned repo on GitHub: `imperishable-wonderland`

Created this writing log that will include sticky notes I use to communicate with viewers when making silent writing videos, along with what I attempted and/or accomplished during my writing sessions.  I will order the log entries so that the most recent writting sessions come first.

Created a new file `contents.txt` in the `images` directory that contains the contents of the image files in that directory.

Added a `README.md` file for the book in the `imperishable` directory, and included the Creative Commons CC BY Attribution 4.0 International license for the book and said that the code was under an MIT license, but to check the code for details.

Added the Creative Commons CC BY Attribution 4.0 International license to a new page in the book itself.  Created a new `macros.tex` file to contain handy LaTeX macros, such as the `wspace` (Will's Space) macro to give just a tiny bit of vertical spacing.

## Monday, March 11, 2024

Created repository, and created initial outline and files.
