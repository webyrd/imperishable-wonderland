# Things I'd Like to Know about Relational Programming

## Can heterogenous towers of interpreters be collapsed?

## What is the semantic relationship between append in Scheme, appendo in miniKanren, and append in a relational Scheme interpreter in miniKanren?

## Is it possible to combine a relational parser, a relational type inferencer or type checker, and a relational interpreter into a single program that can perform program synthesis without entering "generate and test"?

## What exactly is going on in my experiment combining shallow and deep embeddings of miniKanren in miniKanren, where sharing fresh variables in the expression to be synthesized seems to combine the run* expressiveness with the efficienciency of a shallow embedding?  How far can this be pushed?  Is this behavior new, or has it been noticed before?  Does this behavior occur in other contexts?

## Is it possible to combine interpreters implementing operational semantics, axiomatic semantics, denotional semantics, etc., into a single program that can perform semantics-based synthesis and reasoning without entering "generate-and-test"?
